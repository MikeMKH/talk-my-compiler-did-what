# My Compiler Did What? A Look compiler generated C# code.

async / await, record types, generators, C# is starting to look like magic, but I do not believe in magic. In this session we'll look at the state machines, hidden classes and methods that the C# compiler is generating for you when you use async / await, record, and IEnumerable. You'll walk away no longer believe in C# magic and you'll have a much deeper understanding of how the code you write everyday actual works.
